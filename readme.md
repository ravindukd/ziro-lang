Ziro is a hobby project aimed at exploring the concepts behind programming language development. This is a simple interpreter for learning and experimentation, not intended for production use.

---

## Project Overview
Ziro is designed to prioritize simplicity and flexibility. The current implementation focuses on building a basic interpreter capable of tokenizing, parsing, and evaluating user input or scripts. The project is in its early stages, with a focus on foundational elements such as lexical analysis, token management, and an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation.

---

## Project Structure

### Main Class
The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the Ziro interpreter. It handles file-based script execution and an interactive prompt for real-time user input. Key functionalities include:
- **Run File**: Reads and executes a Ziro script from a file.
- **Run Prompt**: Provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for live testing and development.

### Scanner
The `Scanner` class is responsible for lexical analysis. It processes the source code into a series of tokens, which are categorized using the `Token` class. Tokens represent the smallest meaningful units of the language, such as keywords, literals, and operators.

### Token
The `Token` class defines the structure of a token. It includes:
- **Type**: The category of the token (e.g., identifier, keyword, operator).
- **Lexeme**: The textual representation of the token.
- **Literal**: The literal value (if applicable).
- **Line**: The line number where the token appears.

### Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
The AST represents the hierarchical structure of parsed expressions. Key components include:
- **Expr**: The base interface for all expressions.
- **AstPrinter**: A visitor implementation for printing ASTs in a human-readable format. It supports binary, grouping, literal, and unary expressions.

---

## Features Implemented
1. **Interactive Prompt**: Users can type expressions or commands directly into the terminal for immediate feedback.
2. **File Execution**: Scripts can be saved in files and executed via command-line arguments.
3. **Tokenization**: Converts source code into tokens for further processing.
4. **AST Representation**: Parses tokens into an AST and provides a printable representation of expressions.

---

## Usage
Run the interpreter using the following commands:

### Interactive Mode
```bash
java Main
```
This launches a REPL where you can type Ziro expressions interactively.

### Script Mode
```bash
java Main <script_file>
```
Replace `<script_file>` with the path to a Ziro script to execute.

---

## Example Input
### Interactive Prompt Example:
```plaintext
> 1 + 2 * (3 - 4)
(Binary (Unary - Literal 4) (Binary Literal 2 Literal 3))
```

### Script File Example:
Contents of `example.zir`:
```plaintext
print 42;
```
Execution:
```bash
java Main example.zir
Output: 42
```

## Future Plans
- Implement parsing logic to convert tokens into an AST.
- Add an interpreter to evaluate AST nodes.
- Introduce error handling for syntax and runtime errors.
- Extend language features, including variables, control flow, and functions.

## Contributions
This project is intended as a learning experience. Contributions are welcome, but the focus is on understanding and exploring programming language concepts. If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues on the project's repository.
